Description: Music manager with web-bases UI that focus on music
 MusicDB is a music manager with focus on remote access to your music
 collection using a web-based user interface.  It allows you to manage
 an audio stream based on a song-queue.  The WebUI is focusing on
 being a presentation of your music rather than being a database front-end.
