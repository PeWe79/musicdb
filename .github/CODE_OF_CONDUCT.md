Since it's a [hot topic](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16406946) and [GitHub wants me to have it](https://github.com/rstemmer/musicdb/community),
here is the Code Of Conduct for the MusicDB community. (Is a single person a community?) 

---

Just follow the [Hacker Ethics](https://www.ccc.de/en/hackerethics).
In particular "*Hackers should be judged by their acting, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.*"
