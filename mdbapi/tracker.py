"""
This module provides a tracker to track songs and videos that were streamed.
The goal of the tracker is to collect information which songs and videos can be played in series.
So the relation between two songs or videos gets stored in a database - the Tracker Database.
The user can then get the information which song/video were played after (or before) a specific song/video.
Beside the songs, also the artist relations are tracked.

The Tracker consists of two parts:

    * The **Tracker** class (:class:`~mdbapi.tracker.Tracker`) tracking music with an internal queue that holds the last played song or and video.
    * The **Tracker Database** (:class:`~lib.db.trackerdb.TrackerDatabase`) that stores the tracked music relations.

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Dependencies 
        cfg = MusicDBConfig("./musicdb.ini")

        # Create a new tracker
        tracker = Tracker(cfg)
        tracker.AddSong("Unicorn/2000 - Honey Horn/13 Rainbow Song.mp3")
        tracker.AddSong("Truther/2013 - Real Album/23 Illuminati.mp3")

    Skipped music should be ignored.

    Beside the songs, also the artist relations get tracked.
    The artist relation gets derived from the song relations.
