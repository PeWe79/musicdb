This module provides a tracker to track songs that were streamed.
The goal of the tracker is to collect information which songs can be played in series.
So the relation between two songs gets stored in a database - the Tracker Database.
The user can then get the information which song were played after (or before) a specific song.
Beside the songs, also the artist relations are tracked.

The Tracker consists of two parts:

    * The **Tracker** class (:class:`~mdbapi.tracker.Tracker`) tracking songs with an internal queue that holds the last played songs.
    * The **Tracker Database** (:class:`~lib.db.trackerdb.TrackerDatabase`) that stores the tracked song relations.

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Dependencies 
        cfg = MusicDBConfig("./musicdb.ini")

        # Create a new tracker
        tracker = Tracker(cfg)
        tracker.AddSong("Unicorn/2000 - Honey Horn/13 Rainbow Song.mp3")
        tracker.AddSong("Truther/2013 - Real Album/23 Illuminati.mp3")

    This class tracks songs that were played after each other.
    So it gets tracked what songs the user put together into the queue because their style fit to each other.
    It should also track randomly added songs assuming the user skips or removes songs that don't fit.
    Only completely played songs should considered.
    Skipped songs should be ignored.
    Beside the songs, also the artist relations get tracked.
    The artist relation gets derived from the song relations.

        This method tracks the relation to the given song with the last added song.
        This new song should be a song that was recently and completely played.

        If the time between this song, and the previous one exceeds *N* minutes, it gets ignored and the internal state gets reset.
        So the chain of songs get cut if the time between playing them is too long.
        The chain of songs gets also cut, if *songid* is ``None`` or invalid.
        The amount of time until this cut takes place can be configured: :doc:`/basics/config`

        If the given song is the same as the last song, then it gets ignored.

        After adding a song, the method checks for a new relation between two songs.
        This is the case when there was previously a song added.

        If there is a relation to track then the songs get loaded from the :class:`lib.db.musicdb.MusicDatabase` to get the artist IDs.
        The relation gets added to the tracker database by calling :meth:`lib.db.trackerdb.TrackerDatabase.AddRelation`
