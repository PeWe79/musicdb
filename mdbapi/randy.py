This MusicDB component adds a random song under certain constraint into MPDs (Music Playing Daemon) the song-queue

Randy consists of two parts:

* The :meth:`~mdbapi.randy.RandyThread` and its environment :meth:`~mdbapi.randy.StartRandy` and :meth:`mdbapi.randy.StopRandy`.
* The :class:`~mdbapi.randy.RandyInterface` class providing an interface to interact with the :meth:`~mdbapi.randy.RandyThread`. This can happen in several threads simultaneously.

To use Randy, start the :meth:`~mdbapi.randy.RandyThread` by calling :meth:`~mdbapi.randy.StartRandy` once. 
Now it is possible to access the randomizer using the :class:`~mdbapi.randy.RandyInterface` class. This can be done from multiple different threads.
When Randy is not needed anymore, it can be stopped by calling :meth:`~mdbapi.randy.StopRandy`.

.. code-block:: python

    # Dependencies 
    cfg      = MusicDBConfig("./musicdb.ini")

    # Start Randy
    StartRandy(cfg)

    # Use Randy (Can be anywhere in the code)
    randy = RandyInterface()
    randy.AddSong("next")   # add random song after current song
    randy.AddSong("last")   # add random song at the end of the queue

    # Stop Randy

    .. warning::

        This function should not be called directly. Use :meth:`~mdbapi.randy.StartRandy` to execute the Thread!

    This Thread chooses a random song in a two-stage process.
    The first stage selects a song from a limited set of songs, the second stage checks if the song is on a blacklist.
    
    .. warning::

        The process of trying to get a good song gets repeated until a good song is found.
        If over constraint, this ends in an infinite loop!
        

    **Database-Stage**

    The Song gets chosen by the :meth:`lib.db.musicdb.MusicDatabase.GetRandomSong` datebase access call.
    There are 4 parameters that define the set on of possible songs.
    Some of them can be configured in the MusicDB configuration file.

        - The activated genres
        - Flag if *disabled* songs shall be excluded
        - Flag if *hated* songs shall be excluded
        - Minimum length of a song in seconds

    Because the database only takes album tags into account, the song tags gets checked afterwards.
    If the song has a genre tag, and if this tag does not match the filter, the song gets rejected.
    Song genres set by the AI will be ignored because the AI may be wrong.

    **Blacklist-Stage**

    The selected song gets compared to three blacklists of configurable length: Artist, Album, Song.
    If the song is listed in a blacklist, the song, a song from the same album or from the same artist was played in near past.
    So: the chosen song gets dropped and the finding-process starts again.

    Is the blacklist length set to 0, the specific blacklist is disabled

    If a song is found. The oldest entries of the blacklist get dropped, and the new song, album, artist get pushed on top of the list.
    Then the song gets added to the *MPD-Queue* and the ``qrndadds`` statistic gets incremented.
