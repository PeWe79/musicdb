The *randy* module provides a way to select random songs that can be put into the Song Queue.
The selection of random songs follows certain constraints.

Randy consists of two parts:

    * A global `Blacklist`_ for songs, albums and artists
    * A class :class:`~Randy` that provides methods to get random songs


Blacklist
---------

There are three FIFO organized blacklists: For songs, albums and artists.
Each blacklist holds the IDs of the last played songs, albums and artists.

Songs that will be selected by the :class:`~Randy` class will be added to the blacklists automatically.
If a user adds a song into the Queue, this song must be added manually by calling the :meth:`~mdbapi.randy.Randy.AddSongToBlacklist` method.

Once a song got added to the blacklist, it remains even if the song got removed from the queue.

The length of those blacklist can be configured in the MusicDB Configuration:

    .. code-block:: ini

            [Randy]
            songbllen=50
            albumbllen=20
            artistbllen=10

For small music collections, the lengths should not exceed the possibility to provide individual data.
For medium collections and above, the default values as shown in the example are good.
When set to ``0``, the blacklist for the songs, albums or artists will be disabled.

The blacklists get maintained by the :class:`~Randy` class.
Each instance of this class accesses the same global blacklist.

The blacklist is implemented as a dictionary with the keys ``"songs"``, ``"albums"`` and ``"artists"``.
Their values are lists holding the IDs of the songs, albums and artists.

Song Selection Algorithm
------------------------

Selecting a random song is done in two stages, the `Database Stage`_ and the `Blacklist Stage`_
The first stage selects a song from a limited set of songs, the second stage checks if the song is on a blacklist.
In each stage, a song can be rejected and the algorithm starts at the beginning.


.. warning::

    The process of trying to get a good song gets repeated until a good song is found.
    If over constraint, this ends in an infinite loop!


Database Stage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the first stage, a song gets chosen by the database via :meth:`lib.db.musicdb.MusicDatabase.GetRandomSong`.
There are 4 parameters that define the constraints applied on set of possible songs:

    - The activated genres as maintained by the :mod:`lib.cfg.mdbstate` module.
    - The flag if *disabled* songs shall be excluded
    - The flag if *hated* songs shall be excluded
    - Minimum length of a song in seconds

Some of them can be configured in the MusicDB configuration file:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [Randy]
        nodisabled=True
        nohated=True
        minsonglen=120

Because the database only takes album tags into account, the song tags gets checked afterwards.
If the song has a confirmed genre tag, and if this tag does not match the filter, the song gets rejected.
Song genres set by the Music AI (see :doc:`/mdbapi/musicai`) will be ignored because the AI may be wrong.


Blacklist Stage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The selected song from the first stage now gets compared to the three blacklists.
If the song, or its album or artist, is listed in one of blacklist, 
then the song, a song from the same album or from the same artist was played recently.
So, the chosen song gets dropped and the finding-process starts again.

Is the blacklist length set to 0, the specific blacklist is disabled

If a song is found. The oldest entries of the blacklist get dropped, and the new song, album, artist get pushed on top of the list.
