"""
MusicAI is made to set genre tags to songs based on the tags set to albums.

This AI works for on a predefined set of genre.
This set can be defined in the MusicDB Configuration ``[MusicAI]->genrelist``.
The list is bound to the model name also set in the configuration.
If the gerelist changes, the model name should change, too.
Otherwise the datasets loose their relation to the genres.

This module changes two environment variables:

    * ``TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL`` will be set to ``2`` to suppress printing warnings.
    * ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` will be set to ``0``. This is the GPU ID that will be used by TensorFlow.

    def GetGenreMatrix(self):
        r"""
        This method returns a dictionary with the categorization vector for each genre.
        When training a neural network for categorizing, each element of the result-vector is mapped to one category.
        This static mapping is returned by this method.
        The matrix gets dynamic generated out of the configuration of MusicDB.
        The configured genre list gets just transformed into the matirx.

        For example, the mapping for the genrelist ``Metal, NDH, Gothic, Elector`` is the following:

        .. math::

            \begin{pmatrix}
                \text{Metal}\\
                \text{NDH}\\
                \text{Gothic}\\
                \text{Electro}
            \end{pmatrix}

        The format of the mapping is a dictionary with each genre as key.
        Each entry in the dictionary is a vector with the related cell set to 1.0 and the other cells to 0.0. For *Gothic* music, the vector would look like this:

        .. math::

            \text{Gothic} = \begin{pmatrix}
                0.0\\
                0.0\\
