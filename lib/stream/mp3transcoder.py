"""
This module transcodes the users source music into mp3 data that can be streamed via :class:`lib.stream.icecast.IcecastInterface`.
Therefore it uses the :class:`lib.stream.gstreamer.GStreamerInterface` class.
A `GStreamer Pipeline`_ will be created to transcode m4a, mp3 and flac files into a specific mp3 encoding.
The output of the GStreamer Pipeline gets written into a `UNIX Pipe`_.
The data can then be accessed via :mod:`~MP3Transcoder.GetChunk`.

GStreamer Pipeline
------------------

As shown in the graph below, GStreamer is used for the transcoding.
The files get read by the ``filesrc`` element and then be decoded.
The raw audio data gets then be encoded using the ``lamemp3enc`` element.
These mp3 encoded data will then be provided by writing into a `UNIX Pipe`_ for further processing.

    .. graphviz::

        digraph hierarchy {
            size="5,8"

            filesrc       [shape=box, label="filesrc"]
            decodebin     [shape=box, label="decodebin"]
            audioconvert  [shape=box, label="audioconvert"]
            lamemp3enc    [shape=box, label="lamemp3enc"]
            fdsink        [shape=box, label="fdsink"]


            filesrc         -> decodebin
            decodebin       -> audioconvert
            audioconvert    -> lamemp3enc
            lamemp3enc      -> fdsink
        }

The encoding is a MPEG v1 Layer III encoding with 320kb/s and Joint Stereo.

The following example shows the bash representation of the pipeline:

    .. code-block:: bash

        gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=in.m4a ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! lamemp3enc target=1 bitrate=320 cbr=true ! filesink location=out.mp3

        file out.mp3
        #> out.mp3: MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 320 kbps, 44.1 kHz, JntStereo

        ffpribe out.mp3
        #> Duration: 00:03:43.16, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 320 kb/s
        #> Stream #0:0: Audio: mp3, 44100 Hz, stereo, s16p, 320 kb/s

UNIX Pipe
---------

A UNIX Pipe is connected to the ``fdsink`` GStreamer Element.
``fdsink`` writes into the pipe.
Then :meth:`MP3Transcoder.GetChunk` reads some chunks from the mp3 data encoded by the ``lamemp3enc`` Element.

The pipe is accessed non-blocking.

Transcoding
-----------

Transcoding will be done in a separate thread.
To safely work with the :class:`MP3Transcoder` class, you should use the provided context management:

        # GStreamer did not close the file handler for the file to transcode.
        # 
        # Closing them explicitly in python using the deref() method lead to the following issue:
        # Exiting the server lead to lots of "GLib-GObject-CRITICAL"-Errors.
        # These errors where produced in the PyFinalizex-function.
        # After some tries I figured out that all unref-falls needed by GStreamer
        # are done by Pythons garbage collector.

        This method reads a chunk of data that gets provided by the GStreamer ``fdsink`` element from the GStreamer Pipeline.

        It tries to read ``size`` bytes of data.
        
        When reading from the UNIX Pipe fails with an ``BlockingIOError``, than the state of the current transcoding gets checked.
        If it is ``RUNNING``, than the method tries to read from the pipe again after 100ms.
        Otherwise it is assumed that the process of transcoding is complete.

        When 0 bytes were read and the state of the transcoding process is not ``RUNNING``, than it is also assumed that the process is competed.

        In all cases, all collected bytes were returned by this method.
        It may only be less that ``size``.
        When there were less than ``size`` bytes returned, or even ``0``, than the process of transcoding can be considered complete.
