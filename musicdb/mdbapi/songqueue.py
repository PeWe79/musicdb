This module implements the Song Queue.
The song queue consists of a global FIFO organized list.

Queue Management
----------------

An entry in this queue is a dictionary having the following keys:

    entryid:
        An entry ID that is unique for all entries at any time.
        This UUID is a 128 bit integer.
    
    songid:
        A song ID as maintained by the :class:`~musicdb.lib.db.musicdb.MusicDatabase` class.

    israndom:
        A boolean value that is set to ``True`` when the song was added by :doc:`/mdbapi/randy`.


Some features of this queue are:

    * The entry ID is a `Version 4 Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)>`_ .
    * The current playing song is at index 0.
    * The songs remain in the queue until they got completely streamed.
    * This class is thread safe. So each method of the same instance can be called from different threads.
    * The queue is persistent. After restarting MusicDB, the queue is not lost.

Furthermore this module cooperates the Randy module (see: :doc:`/mdbapi/randy`)
When the queue runs empty, a new random song gets append to the queue.


Event Management
----------------

This module provided a callback interface to react on events triggered on changes in the Song Queue.

The following two functions can be used to register or remove a callback function:

    * :meth:`~SongQueue.RegisterCallback`
    * :meth:`~SongQueue.RemoveCallback`

Functions that get called must provide two parameters.
The first is a string that provides the name of the event as described below.
The second parameter contains an event specific argument, or ``None``.

A return value gets not handled.

The following events exist:

    SongQueueChanged:
        Gets triggered when the Song Queue changes

    SongChanged:
        When the current playing song changes.

Examples
--------

    The following example shows how the :meth:`~SongQueue.NextSong` method works:

    .. code-block:: python

        queue = SongQueue(mdbconfig, musicdatabase)
        queue.AddSong(7357)         # 7357 is a song ID
        queue.AddSong(1337)
        queue.AddSong(2342)

        print(queue.CurrentSong()["songid"])  # 7357
        print(queue.CurrentSong()["songid"])  # 7357
        print(queue.NextSong()["songid"])     # 1337
        print(queue.CurrentSong()["songid"])  # 1337

        queueentry = queue.CurrentSong()
        if queueentry["israndom"]:
            print("Entry %d is a randomly added song."%(queueentry["entryid"]))
