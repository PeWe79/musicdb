This module provides a tracker to track songs and videos that were streamed.
The goal of the tracker is to collect information which songs and videos can be played in series.
So the relation between two songs or videos gets stored in a database - the Tracker Database.
The user can then get the information which song/video were played after (or before) a specific song/video.

The Tracker consists of the following parts:

    * The **Tracker** class (:class:`~musicdb.mdbapi.tracker.Tracker`) tracking music with an internal queue that holds the last played song or and video.
    * The **Tracker Database** (:class:`~musicdb.lib.db.trackerdb.TrackerDatabase`) that stores the tracked music relations.

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Dependencies 
        cfg = MusicDBConfig("./musicdb.ini")

        # Create a new tracker
        tracker = SongTracker(cfg)
        tracker.AddSong("Unicorn/2000 - Honey Horn/13 Rainbow Song.mp3")
        tracker.AddSong("Truther/2013 - Real Album/23 Illuminati.mp3")

        This method tracks the relation to the given target with the last added target.
        It also tracks when music was played.
        A target can be a song or a video.
        This new target should be a target that was recently and completely played.

        The played music will always be tracked via :meth:`musicdb.lib.db.trackerdb.TrackerDatabase.AddMusic`.

        Additional, under certain conditions, the chain of consecutive played music gets tracked.
        This process is described in the following paragraphs.

        If the time between this target, and the previous one exceeds *N* minutes, it gets ignored and the internal state gets reset.
        So the chain of targets get cut if the time between playing them is too long.
        The amount of time until this cut takes place can be configured: :doc:`/basics/config`
        The chain of targets gets also cut, if ``targetid`` is ``None`` or invalid.

        If the given target is the same as the last target, then it gets ignored.

        The ``israndom`` parameter indicates if a target got added by the randomizer into the queue.
        The behavior of the tracker then depends on the ``[tracker]->trackrandom`` settings.
        If ``israndom`` and ``trackrandom`` are both ``True``, the music gets tracked as if it was added by the user.
        If ``trackrandom`` is ``False``, randomly added music gets not tracked.
        Anyway, the chain will not be cut. So the next music continues the chain.

        After adding a target, the method checks for a new relation between two targets.
        This is the case when there was previously a target added.

        The relation gets added to the tracker database by calling :meth:`musicdb.lib.db.trackerdb.TrackerDatabase.AddRelation`

        Args:
            targetid: ID of the song or video that gets currently played, ``None`` to cut the chain of consecutive targets.
            israndom (bool): ``True`` indicates that the music was added by the random song selection algorithm Randy.

            ``True`` on success. ``False`` in case an error occurred.
