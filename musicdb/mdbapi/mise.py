This module provides a class to search for songs, albums and artists.
A fuzzy search algorithm gets used.
This not only allows typos, it also adapts the search to the natural situation that song names are hard to remember.

Before an object can be used, the :meth:`~musicdb.mdbapi.mise.MusicDBMicroSearchEngine.UpdateCache`
method must be called to generate the cache.

The cache consists of three lists of tuples. One list for Artists, Albums and Songs.
The Tuples contain the *ID* and the *normalized Name* (see :meth:`~musicdb.mdbapi.mise.MusicDBMicroSearchEngine.NormalizeString`).

If the `Levenshtein module <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-Levenshtein>`_ is installed, the search through all artists, albums and song is usually done in less than 100ms.
Without this module, you better not use this module only if time does matter.

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        database = MusicDBConfig()
        mise     = MusicDBMicroSeachEngine(database)

        mise.UpdateCache()

        (artists, _ , _ ) = mise.Find("Rammsein")
        for artistid, conf in artists:
            artist = database.GetArtistById(artistid)
            print("Artist: %s, Confidence: %d"%(artist["name"], conf))
