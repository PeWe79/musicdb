The task management is responsible for managing
    * Uploads new content to the server (:doc:`/taskmanagement/uploadmanager`)
    * Integration of new content into the Music Directory (:doc:`/taskmanagement/integrationmanager`)
    * Import of music into the MuiscDB Database (:doc:`/taskmanagement/importmanager`)
    * Importing artwork for an album (:doc:`/taskmanagement/artworkmanager`)
    * Scanning the file system for new or invalid data (:doc:`/taskmanagement/filesystemmanager`)

The whole process is split into several tasks managed by the :meth:`~TaskManagementThread`.

The communication is handled via notification to allow continuing reporting of status updates
without blocking and even when the connection gets lost in the meanwhile.

Furthermore uploading a file, integrating it into the music directory and importing it into the Music Database
is possible in separate steps.

The whole process is split into several tasks. Each task has its own state.
The task state is persistently stored inside the uploads directory within a JSON file in a *tasks* sub-directory.
The file name is the task ID (equivalent to the Upload ID) + ``.json``.

Possible Task states:

    * Unrelated states
        * ``"new"``: A new created, not yet initialized task.
        * ``"notexisting"`` In case a Task ID does not match any file. This task does not exist.
        * ``"invalidcontent"``: Processing failed. The content type was unexpected or invalid (Not: artwork, video, album).
        * ``"remove"``: Upload is going to be removed. The task itself as well. After this state appears, the task ID should no longer be considered as valid.
    * Upload related states:
        * ``"waitforchunk"``: A new chunk of data was requested, and is expected from the client
        * ``"uploadfailed"``: The upload failed
        * ``"uploadcomplete"``: The whole file is now available in the temporary upload directory and is ready for being preprocessed.
        * ``"preprocessing"``: The file is currently in preprocessing state. For example if an archive gets unpacked.
    * Integration related states:
        * ``"readyforintegration"``: The integration of the file can be started
        * ``"startintegration"``: Start the integration process
        * ``"integrating"``: The integration process has started
        * ``"integrationfailed"``: Integrating the uploaded file into the music directory failed
    * Import related states:
        * ``"readyforimport"``: The uploaded file was successfully integrated into the music directory. The content can now be imported into the MusicDB Database. Everything is now based on file management inside the managed Music Directory. From this state, ``"remove"`` gets triggered.
        * ``"startmusicimport"``: Importing the integrated file into the music database started
        * ``"importingmusic"``: The music import process has started
        * ``"importfailed"``: Import process failed (importing the music or generating the artwork)
        * ``"startartworkimport"``: Importing succeeded and generating the artwork started
        * ``"importingartwork"``: The artwork import process has started
        * ``"importcomplete"``: Import process complete and successful
    * File system scanning states:
        * ``"startfsscan"``:
        * ``"scanningfs"``:
        * ``"fsscanfailed"``:
        * ``"fsscancomplete"``:

To each task, there are several additional information, also stored in the JSON file.
The following keys are in dictionary that represent a task:

    * Unrelated information
        * ``"id"`` (str): The task ID
        * ``"state"`` (str): One of the task states listed above
        * ``"contenttype"`` (str): Type of the content: (``"video"``, ``"albumfile"``, ``"artwork"``, ``"any"``). An album file can a song but also a booklet PDF, a video clip or any other additional content of an album.
        * ``"mimetype"`` (str): MIME-Type of the file (For example ``"image/png"``)
        * ``"annotations"`` (dict): Additional annotations that can be provided by the user and be optionally used by some task processing.
        * ``"initializationtime"`` (int): The unix time stamp when the task has been created
        * ``"updatetime"`` (int): Unix time stamp when the task has been updated the last time via :meth:`~musicdb.taskmanagement.taskmanager.TaskManager.UpdateTaskState`. After initialization it is ``None``.
    * Upload related information (May not be valid if there was no upload task)
        * ``"filesize"`` (int): The size of the file in Bytes
        * ``"offset"`` (int): The amount of existing bytes of a file that is currently being uploaded.
        * ``"uploadpath"`` (str): Path of the file in that the uploaded data gets written to Relative to the Upload Directory.
        * ``"preprocessedpath"`` (str): Path of preprocessed data. If available, it should be preferred to ``"uploadpath"``. The path is relative to the Upload directory.
        * ``"sourcefilename"`` (str): Name of the original file that got uploaded.
        * ``"sourcechecksum"`` (str): Checksum of the original file that got uploaded.
    * Integration related information (May not be valid if the file is not yet integrated into the Music Directory)
        * ``"videopath"`` (str): Path to a video file, relative to the Music Directory
        * ``"albumpath"`` (str): Path to an album directory, relative to the Music Directory
        * ``"albumfilepath"`` (str): Path to file of an album, relative to the Music Directory
    * Artwork related
        * ``"awsourcetype"`` (str): Type of the artwork source: ``"imagefile"``, ``"songfile"`` or ``"videofile"``.
        * ``"awsourcepath"`` (str): Path to the artwork source

After upload is complete,
the Management Thread takes care about post processing or removing no longer needed content
The uploaded file follows the following naming scheme: *contenttype* + ``-`` + *checksum* + ``.`` + source-file-extension
The upload manager also takes care about the validity of the uploaded file (via SHA-1 checksum).

After an import is completed successfully, all clients connected to the server get a ``"sys:refresh"`` notification
to update their caches.
This notification is generated via :meth:`musicdb.mdbapi.server.UpdateCaches`.
