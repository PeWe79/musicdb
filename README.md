</p>

MusicDB is a music manager with focus on remote access to your music collection using a web-based user interface.
It allows you to manage an audio stream based on a song-queue.
The WebUI is focusing on being a presentation of your music rather than being a database front-end.

So, when you are listening to your music, you do not work with software.
Instead you explore your music collection.

I started this project on 4th January 2014.
Since I finished a first prototype within one weekend, I use MusicDB almost every day.
Time to share it with the world. :smiley:


### Features

* **Private:** Your music is stored on your private server.
* **Everywhere:** Control via Web Application. Listen via audio stream.
* **Visual:** Albums and songs are represented by their artwork.
* **Presentation:** MusicDB presents your music. It does not feel like a Database Front-end. No meta data overloaded list-based UI.
* **Typos Allowed:** Fuzzy search allows you to have some typos when searching your music collection.
* **Focused:** Hide all music not tagged with the genres you currently like to listen to.
* **Annotate:** Use custom flags to annotate songs with specific moods or themes.
* **Queue Based:** No playlist management distracts you from your music. Put a songs into the queue, then it will be played.
* **Single User:** MusicDB is a Single-User Multi-Client application. Connect all your computers to MusicDB without messing around with user management.
* **No Limits:** Scales with music collections of hundreds of albums.
* **Independence:** Keeps your music directory clean to use it with other tools as well. The file system is ground truth, not the database.

## Using MusicDB

</p>

### Start Managing your Music

The start page of [:notebook: MusicDB's Documentation](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/index.html)
should give you the help you need to start - or at least the links to the chapters that do
(like the [:notebook: CLI MODULES chapters)](https://m45ch1n3.de/musicdb/docs/build/html/index.html#musicdb-cli).
The documentation is made for developers, not only users. So there is much more information than you will need to use MusicDB.


In general, the first steps are the following, after you have done the [:notebook: First Run](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/usage/install.html#first-run):
With the new WebUI, creating *Moods* and *Genres* can also be done within the web user interface.
Open the Settings via the WebUI main menu (top right).

1. [:notebook: Add Music](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/usage/music.html#importing-albums-to-musicdb) to MusicDB
2. [:notebook: Create Genres](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/mod/genres.html) and sub-genres you want to use to categorize your Music.
3. [:notebook: Create Moods](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/mod/moods.html) you want to assign to your songs.
4. Open the WebUI in your browser and tag the albums with the genres you created. (Right click on the albums title in the Album View). Then the random song selection process can start working and stops printing warnings.


Some helpful hints:

* For security reasons, MusicDB only accepts connections from localhost by default. Change the [:notebook: WebSocket address configuration](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/basics/config.html#websocket) to access your music from anywhere.
* Make sure the web browser accepts your certificates in case they are self signed (including the WebSocket port)
* Don't be to specific with the genre tags. Define only one tag per genre like *Metal*, *Pop*, *Classic*, …
* Use sub-genre tags for a more detailed classification.
* Tag albums beforehand and songs only when they are currently playing.
* Set mood-flags only for the current playing song.
* Check the [:notebook: Configuration of Randy](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/basics/config.html#randy) to make sure the random song selection can work with your music collection. When you have a small music collection, decrease the blacklist sizes.
* In the Album-View panel, right click on the album title opens a panel for tagging and defining a color scheme for the album.
* Right click on a song name inside the Album-View allows detailed tagging and pre"view"ing a song.
* When defining the Album-View colors, pay attention to good contrast and follow the color scheme of the album cover.


If there are any problems setting up MusicDB, create an issue.

## Technical Details

### Requirements

I test MusicDB only with the latest version of the requirements listed below.
If MusicDB breaks when updating dependencies, it's a bug in MusicDB.
Then please create an issue including the name and version of the dependency that causes issues.
In case MusicDB does not run on outdated operating systems, update your system :wink:

* A Linux operating system (Obviously :smiley: )
* [Python3 >= 3.8](https://www.python.org/) for the Back End
* [Icecast](https://icecast.org/) and [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) for streaming
* [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) for serving the Web User Interface
* A detailed list of all dependencies can be found in the [Install from Source](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/usage/install.html) documentation

I develop and operate MusicDB on an [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) for x86-64. So on this system it will run most reliable :smiley:.
Periodically I test MusicDB also on an [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) with [Ubuntu Server 20.04.2 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi).


### Tests

The following matrix shows on which Linux Distributions I tested the MusicDB back end and if it succeeded.

| MusicDB | Arch Linux | Fedora | Ubuntu |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8.0.0 | OK | OK | not tested |

The following matrix shows with which web browsers I tested the MusicDB front end and if it succeeded.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8.0.0 | OK | failed<sup>1</sup> | not tested |

<sup>1: **Not yet supported** as long as mandatory [CSS features](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask) are missing</sup>

# Development

This section describes how to contribute to this project.


## Documentation

The [:notebook: MusicDB Documentation](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/index.html) is a good point to start.
There are all concepts, interfaces and details described.

Most important will be the [:notebook: Quick Start Section](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/index.html#quick-development-start) that points out some chapters to start reading.

* … and [:notebook: Philosophy of MusicDB](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/basics/concept.html)
* Branch from *master*.
* Please don't commit *docs/build*.


## Roadmap

*MusicDB* is under active development.
Beside maintaining this software, I also think about improving it or adding new features if necessary.
The following list contains all huge improvements I'm planning to add to MusicDB.

* [Alpha State] Integrate music videos into the MusicDB infrastructure. The UI should be switch to video-mode. Then, instead of showing artists and their albums, artists and their videos will be shown. The videos can then be put into a video-queue that get streamed.
  * This feature is currently experimental and deactivated by default.
  * Development progress can be seen on the [corresponding GitHub Project page](https://github.com/rstemmer/musicdb/projects/1).
* [Rough Idea] Next generation of *MusicAI*. I already miss the old one that was surprisingly helpful tagging songs. The next generation might base on TensorFlow 2.0 directly. I will have the same or similar architecture since it worked in the past.
* [Planning State] Usage improvements by allowing installing MusicDB via `pip` and operating it via `systemd`.
* [Planning State] More ideas can be found on the [Roadmap GitHub Project page](https://github.com/rstemmer/musicdb/projects/4)
