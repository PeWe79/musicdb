# musicdb
A music manager with focus on remote access to your music using a webui and MPD for streaming

I'm working on the documentation and some major changes to make this great software useful for more people than me.
If this is done (I guess by the end of the year) I'll publish it here.

Until now I spent more than 6 years of development into the tool.
And since I finished a first test version, I use it nearly every day.
Time to share it with the world :)
