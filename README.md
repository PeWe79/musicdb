# MusicDB

**Your Music. Your Cloud.**

MusicDB is a music manager with focus on remote access to your music collection using a web-based user interface.
It allows you to manage an audio stream based on a song-queue.
The WebUI is focusing on being a presentation of your music rather than being a database front-end.

So, when you are listening to your music, you do not work with software.
Instead you explore your music collection.

I started this project on 4th January 2014.
Since I finished a first prototype within one weekend, I use MusicDB almost every day.
Time to share it with the world. :smiley:

## Socialize

Providing and maintaining open source software comes with some downsides and a lot of work.
I'd like to know if anyone is using this software, and what you are doing with it. :smiley:

So feel free to use the new [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rstemmer/musicdb/discussions) feature to provide some feedback. Or simply â˜† the repository.

You can also follow my project account [@MusicDBProject](https://twitter.com/MusicDBProject) on Twitter
and share some screenshots :wink:

In case you find any bugs, please [create an Issue](https://github.com/rstemmer/musicdb/issues).
Feature requests are welcome as well.


# Using MusicDB

This section describes how to install, update and use MusicDB.

## Requirements

I test MusicDB only with the latest version of the requirements listed below.
If MusicDB breaks when updating dependencies, it's a bug in MusicDB.
Then please create an issue including the name and version of the dependency that causes issues.
In case MusicDB does not run on outdated operating systems, update your system :wink:

* A Linux operating system. Tested with:
  * [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) for x86-64 (primary test and development system)
  * [Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/) for x86-64 (not recommended because it comes with lots of ~~old~~ "stable" software)
  * [Ubuntu Server 20.04.2 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi) for AArch64 on a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/) (At least Python 3.5. I test with Python 3.9)
* [Icecast](https://icecast.org/) and [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) for streaming
* Support status for web browsers to access the WebUI:
  * [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) (**Recommended**)
  * [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) (**Not yet supported** as long as mandatory [CSS features](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask) are missing)
  * [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) (Not tested - see Chrome)
  * [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/) (Not tested - see Chrome)
  * [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) (Not tested)
* A Unicode capable file system (Any *modern* file system should work)
* A terminal that supports Unicode, with an Unicode capable font configured (I use KDE's [Konsole](https://www.kde.org/applications/system/konsole/) with [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/))

The `install.sh` script checks for tools needed to install MusicDB.
Furthermore `check.sh` list all tools and Python modules needed by MusicDB.
You can run the check-script at any time. 

A detailed list can be found on [:notebook: How to Install MusicDB](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/usage/install.html) in the documentation.


Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install a basic set of Python modules needed for MusicDB.
I recommend to try to get the modules from the distributions package manager.

You should use the latest versions of these dependencies and update them regularly.
When MusicDB breaks because of an updated dependency create a ticket.
I then will fix MusicDB as soon as possible.


## Installation and Update

### Download

The latest releases can be found in the [GitHubs Releases Section](https://github.com/rstemmer/musicdb/releases).
You can also use `git clone` and install from the *master* branch.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rstemmer/musicdb.git
```

### Installation of MusicDB

To install MusicDB, read [:notebook: How to Install MusicDB](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/usage/install.html) in the documentation.

### Update to a New Version

Updating can be done by the following simple steps.
Read the *Important News* for manual steps to do before updating to a new major release.
Only execute the scripts as root, that are followed by the comment "as root"!

``` bash
git checkout master # Only install from master branch!
git pull

cd scripts
./update.sh # as root
```

## Usage

The start page of [:notebook: MusicDB's Documentation](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/index.html)
should give you the help you need to start - or at least the links to the chapters that do
(like the [:notebook: CLI MODULES chapters)](https://m45ch1n3.de/musicdb/docs/build/html/index.html#musicdb-cli).
The documentation is made for developers, not only users. So there is much more information than you will need to use MusicDB.


In general, the first steps are the following, after you have done the [:notebook: First Run](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/usage/install.html#first-run):
With the new WebUI, creating *Moods* and *Genres* can also be done within the web user interface.
Open the Settings via the WebUI main menu (top right).

1. [:notebook: Add Music](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/usage/music.html#importing-albums-to-musicdb) to MusicDB
2. [:notebook: Create Genres](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/mod/genres.html) and sub-genres you want to use to categorize your Music.
3. [:notebook: Create Moods](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/mod/moods.html) you want to assign to your songs.
4. Open the WebUI in your browser and tag the albums with the genres you created. (Right click on the albums title in the Album View). Then the random song selection process can start working and stops printing warnings.


Some helpful hints:

* For security reasons, MusicDB only accepts connections from localhost by default. Change the [:notebook: WebSocket address configuration](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/basics/config.html#websocket) to access your music from anywhere.
* Make sure the web browser accepts your certificates in case they are self signed (including the WebSocket port)
* Don't be to specific with the genre tags. Define only one tag per genre like *Metal*, *Pop*, *Classic*, â€¦
* Use sub-genre tags for a more detailed classification.
* Tag albums beforehand and songs only when they are currently playing.
* Set mood-flags only for the current playing song.
* Check the [:notebook: Configuration of Randy](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/basics/config.html#randy) to make sure the random song selection can work with your music collection. When you have a small music collection, decrease the blacklist sizes.
* In the Album-View panel, right click on the album title opens a panel for tagging and defining a color scheme for the album.
* Right click on a song name inside the Album-View allows detailed tagging and pre"view"ing a song.
* When defining the Album-View colors, pay attention to good contrast and follow the color scheme of the album cover.


If there are any problems setting up MusicDB, create an issue.

* Please don't commit *docs/build*.


# Roadmap

*MusicDB* is under active development.
Beside maintaining this software, I also think about improving it or adding new features if necessary.
The following list contains all huge improvements I'm planning to add to MusicDB.

* [Alpha State] Integrate music videos into the MusicDB infrastructure. The UI should be switch to video-mode. Then, instead of showing artists and their albums, artists and their videos will be shown. The videos can then be put into a video-queue that get streamed.
  * This feature is currently experimental and deactivated by default.
  * Development progress can be seen on the [corresponding GitHub Project page](https://github.com/rstemmer/musicdb/projects/1).
* [Rough Idea] Next generation of *MusicAI*. I already miss the old one that was surprisingly helpful tagging songs. The next generation might base on TensorFlow 2.0 directly. I will have the same or similar architecture since it worked in the past.
* [Planning State] Usage improvements by allowing installing MusicDB via `pip` and operating it via `systemd`.
* [Planning State] More ideas can be found on the [Roadmap GitHub Project page](https://github.com/rstemmer/musicdb/projects/4)
