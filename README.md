# musicdb

MusicDB is a music manager with focus on remote access to your music using a WebUI and MPD for streaming.
It is more a presentation of your music than a database frontend.

Until now I spent more than 6 years for developing this software.
Since I finished a first test version, I use it nearly every day.
Time to share it with the world :)

## Social

Providing and maintaining open source software comes with some downsides.
I'd like to know if anyone is using this software, and what they are doing with it.

So feel free to follow my project account [@MusicDBProject](https://twitter.com/MusicDBProject) on twitter
or e-mail me.

## Contributing

Every help is welcome. It starts by easy things like writing an Issue in the issue tracker when you find a bug.
You can also improve the documentation.
Suggesting features via Issue is also possible.

Please don't commit docs/build if it is not mandatory.
Read [Working on MusicDB's Code](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/basics/workflow.html)
and [Basic Rules for MusicDB](https://rstemmer.github.io/musicdb/build/html/basics/concept.html) before
you start editing code.

## Versioning

I work on MusicDB in three sprints per year. Each sprint is about one and a half week long.
The rest of the year I only want to concentrate on fixing critical bugs.
I'm a bit struggling pressing my development workflow in suitable versioning and git management.
