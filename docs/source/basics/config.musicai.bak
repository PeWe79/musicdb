MusicAI
-------

modelpath (path to directory):
   Directory where the models and training data are stored

tmppath (path to directory):
   A path to store temporary data.

logpath (path to directory):
   Path for logfiles of training runs

spectrogrampath (path to directory):
   Temporary path for generated spectrograms
   This path should survives reboots.
   Because the data generation takes much time,
   it is better to have a "backup" of the temporary data.
   So, they must not be generated again after changes or crashes.
   If the model is trained, they can be removed.

genrelist (a list of genrenames):
   These are the genres the AI will use.
   They must have the same name as they are listed in the database.
   **Once this value is set, it should never be changed because it destroys the datasets and models the list was used for.**
   **This entry is bound to the model name**

modelname (string):
   Name of the model.
   **This entry is bound to the genre list.**
   All data is bound to the model name.
   Different CDNNs can be trained/used by changing this name.

slicesize (number ∈ ℕ):
   Size of a slice of a spectrogram to work with

epoch (number ∈ ℕ):
   Number of epoch for the training

batchsize (number ∈ ℕ):
   Size of one training batch - This should be as much as the GPUs Memory can hold, but not one byte more.

usegpu (boolean):
   Can be used to disable using the GPU - Not recommended!
